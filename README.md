- 👋 Hi, I’m @simlav000
- 👀 I’m interested in physics simulations, music, electronics and I'd love to try my hand at graphics programming someday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use ROOT to do some analysis of ATLAS data and find some multiquark states.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project involving graphics programming, or maybe even a game jam.
